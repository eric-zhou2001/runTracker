# runTracker
Developing an application that provides new/interesting insight into your daily exercise routines.

# Final Idea:
 - User login/authentication, all information stored in database.
 - User can log their runs
 - Allows users to view their runs to notice patterns in when they run, what months they run during, etc...
 - Provide interesting open-source charts for analysis

# Technologies:
 - Developed front-end in HTML/CSS/JS from scratch
 - Developing back-end in PHP with MySQL and AJAX
 - Using WAMP as a local testing server, ideally will use database online as project reaches final stages.
 
 # Goal:
 - I wanted to learn more back-end technologies that were different than just Python/Node.js.
 - Value in learning "older" (PHP) coding methods, learn more about how browsers/pages work
 - Begin to develop an understanding of how databases work (in terms of tables rather than JSON files)

 # TODO
 - Add open source data visualization. Bar graphs maybe? Do some research on this
 - Solve known issues in issues tab
 - Develop Login page/database.

 # Open Source Material
 - Fancy alerts, used https://github.com/t4t5/sweetalert
 - Data visualization, take a look into https://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js/getting-started.html. Look into searching algorithms + what would be most efficient. I can think of brute-force methods, but consider researching into what we can use.
